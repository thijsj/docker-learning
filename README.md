# Learning Docker

Figuring out how docker works is the main goal of this repository. I've created several sub projects in the directories.

For a reverse proxy I want to try out [Traefik Proxy](https://traefik.io), because it can auto discover docker containers. See [Traefik Test](traefik-test) for this project.
